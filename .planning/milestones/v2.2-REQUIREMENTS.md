## v2.2 Requirements

Artisan command parsing for OT2 (fan), READ (telemetry), and UNITS (temperature scale).

### Command Parsing

- [x] **CMD-01**: OT2 command parses `OT2,{n}` format and sets fan speed (0-100)
  - Implemented in Phase 35
  - Features: Decimal rounding, clamping 0-100, heater stop on out-of-range
  
- [x] **CMD-02**: READ command triggers ArtisanFormatter response (BT,ET,FAN,HEATER CSV)
  - Implemented in Phase 36
  - Format: ET,BT,-1,-1,-1,FAN,HEATER with one decimal place
  
- [x] **CMD-03**: UNITS command parses `UNITS,{C|F}` format (no conversion applied)
  - Implemented in Phase 37
  - Features: TemperatureScale enum, TemperatureSettings storage, default Celsius

### ArtisanFormatter

- [x] **FMT-01**: BT2/ET2 disabled channels comment added to format_read_response function
  - Implemented in Phase 36
  - Comment: "store value for future et2 and bt2 support"

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Fan rate limiting (25 pts/sec) | Not required for basic V1 functionality |
| IO3 alias for OT2 | Legacy backward compat, not critical |
| Temperature C↔F conversion | Parsed only, no state change |
| READ format validation tests | Deferred to future |
| Artisan handshake sequence | Not required for basic control |

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| CMD-01 | Phase 35 | ✅ Complete |
| CMD-02 | Phase 36 | ✅ Complete |
| CMD-03 | Phase 37 | ✅ Complete |
| FMT-01 | Phase 36 | ✅ Complete |
