# Clippy configuration for LibreRoaster ESP32-C3 firmware

# Embedded Rust constraints:
# - Cloudflare November 2025 outage caused by unhandled unwrap() in production
# - embassy-rs: panic in one task crashes entire executor
# - No_std environment: cannot use standard panic handlers

# This configuration provides code complexity thresholds for embedded clarity.
