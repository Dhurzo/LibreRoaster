<objective>
Create comprehensive UART Logging Guide documenting v1.7 logging features for power users.

Purpose: Help power users who already connect to serial console understand what the logs mean, how to interpret different log levels, and recognize patterns that indicate problems.

Output: UART_LOGGING_GUIDE.md with progressive structure (Overview → Format → Levels → Troubleshooting)
</objective>

**Key decisions from context:**
- Target audience: Power users (serial output readers), not embedded developers
- Guide structure: Progressive complexity - Overview → Format → Levels → Troubleshooting
- Format coverage: Complete syntax [HH:MM:SS.mmm] [CHANNEL] message with annotated examples
- Levels coverage: What each level means and when users see them
- Troubleshooting: Problem patterns that indicate issues
</context>

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Analyze existing logging implementation</name>
  <files>src/logging/*.rs, src/drain_task.rs, Cargo.toml</files>
  <action>Read logging implementation files to understand actual log format, channel prefixes, and log levels used. Identify sample log output patterns that will be used in documentation examples. Verify defmt format strings and channel naming conventions (USB, UART, SYSTEM).</action>
  <verify>grep "log_channel\!\|defmt::\|println\!" patterns identify log channels, format strings, and output examples</verify>
  <done>Clear understanding of actual log format, channels, and levels for accurate documentation</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create UART Logging Guide document</name>
  <files>UART_LOGGING_GUIDE.md</files>
  <action>Create UART_LOGGING_GUIDE.md with four sections:

**1. Overview** — Purpose and value of UART logging for debugging Artisan communication issues. Explain what power users can accomplish with these logs.

**2. Format** — Annotated log examples showing [HH:MM:SS.mmm] [CHANNEL] message syntax. Break down each component:
- Timestamp format and meaning
- Channel prefixes ([USB], [UART], [SYSTEM]) and their differences
- Message format from defmt output
Use visual callouts or annotations to highlight each element in sample log lines.

**3. Levels** — Explain log levels used in v1.7:
- What each level means (INFO, DEBUG, WARN, ERROR)
- When users see each level during normal operation
- Practical guidance on what to look for

**4. Troubleshooting** — Common log patterns that indicate problems:
- Error patterns to recognize
- Warning signs in log output
- How to identify Artisan communication issues in logs

Use technical but accessible tone. Focus on interpretation, not configuration. Reference actual log patterns discovered in Task 1.</action>
  <verify>UART_LOGGING_GUIDE.md exists with all four sections (Overview, Format, Levels, Troubleshooting)</verify>
  <done>Complete UART Logging Guide ready for power users to understand and use v1.7 logging features</done>
